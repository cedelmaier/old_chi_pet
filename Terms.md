* Run: The collection of simulations where that try to test a hypothesis. A run stores all simulation in the "simulations" folder when created. Runs can be classified as: 
  * Scan - One parameter is varied (usually linearly or logarithmically) while all other parameters are kept constant
  * Slice - Two or more parameters are varied with all possible combinations used.
  * Shotgun - Multiple parameters are randomly varied with one another covering the entire parameter space. Useful when parameter space is large and wish to use something like Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE)
  * Single - All parameters are held constant. This means that a simulation and run are the same but still require different directories.
* Simulation(sim):
* Seed(sd):
* State:
* multiprocessor job:
* parallel processor job:
